TODO:
- create thread
- unicode

BUGS:
- if strlen from first backslash is == 0
- if first letter is backslash, i.e. "\\a\\", going up causes error






DONE?:
- quick search
  - create a separate thread so we don't stall
  - list the result in files panel
  - fuzzy find
- bookmarks
  - make it as robust as possible
- context menu
  - clean the code

DONE:
- proper tab
- fix path with 2+ backslash
- filename hover is clipped on the bottom of scroll
- if path is invalid, don't save

SKIPPED:
- docking
  - don't know how to add custom trailing tab, skip for now
